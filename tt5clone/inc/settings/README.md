# dualtone-settings
Submodule with the DualTone_Settings class

To add this module in your theme, move to the theme folder and execute the following command:

`git submodule add git@github.com:dballari/dualtone-settings.git inc/settings`

Then go to your functions file, include the settings class file and instantiate the class.

You will also need to add the DualTone_theme class, and instantiate it.

`git submodule add git@github.com:dballari/dualtone-theme.git inc/theme`

And example of this is provided in the tt5clone-meetup-mataro repository.
